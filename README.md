# Aliexpress_PriceChecker

My first Project that I am trying to solve my very own problem.

Making a project where -- 
=> You can add links of a specific product from Aliexpress
=> it will show all the price, the picture and necessary details of that product 
=> it will use the current price of USD from google to convert it to BDT (for noow only BDT)
=> It will store the data fetched eveytime it has been run
